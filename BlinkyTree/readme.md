# Blinky Tree

This is the Yún configuration for our Christmas tree at home. The board has a string of 50 SK6812 lights (neoPixels) attached to it on pin 12. The www directory in this repository lives at ``/www/tree/`` on the Linux processor of the Yún. It can be accessed via ``http://your.yuns.ip.address/tree``. It's written in [p5.js](http://www.p5js.org). 

[Details of the full implementation](https://www.tigoe.com/pcomp/code/arduinowiring/1249/#more-1249) are available on my blog.
